AnATLyzer
=========

AnATLyzer is an static analyser for ATL model transformations. It
extends the regular ATL editor with problem markers related to typing and
rule usage problems, quick fixes, quick assists and visualizations.
It can also be used as a programmatic API to manipulate ATL 
model transformations taking advantage of the typing information
generated by anATLyzer.
