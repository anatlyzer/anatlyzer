Running tests that use the constraint solver
============================================

There is a conflict between the versions of ANTLR used by TCS and USE.
In normal model all plug-in libraries are loaded by the same class loader
and the TCS ANTLR "wins" provoking a runtime error in the USE parser.

To avoid that the test should launched using the Eclipse infrastructure.
Steps:
	1. Create Junit Plug-in Test configuration
	2. Uncheck "Run in UI thread"
	3. Select "Main" tab -> "Run in application" -> [No application] Headless mode
	4. To speed up the launching process:
		- Goto "Plug-ins" tab
		- Select "Launch with" -> Plugins selected below only
		- Click "Deselect all"
		- Uncheck "Include optional dependencies when computing required plugins"
		- Click on "Required plugins"
		- In the filter text box enter: org.antlr.runtime
		  Only version v3.0.0 of the org.antlr.runtime plug-in should be checked
